# <span style="color:#76a039">Hexagonal Frontend Skill — Design Spec</span>

> **Status:** Draft — no plan or implementation yet
>
> **Companion spec:** [Hexagonal Architecture Skill](../../../done/skills/hexagonal/2026-05-17-hexagonal-architecture-skill.md)

---

## <span style="color:#76a039">Why This Exists</span>

The existing `/hexagonal` skill governs backend service-layer code: controllers, use-cases, repositories, and data adapters. When a feature is end-to-end, the frontend needs the same architectural discipline — domain-named components, use-case-driven logic, and clean separation — but the layer set is different. A React client has no HTTP controller (components are the entry point) and no separate data adapter (repositories call the backend API directly). A standalone companion skill captures these differences without complicating the backend skill.

---

## <span style="color:#76a039">Skill Structure</span>

Two files, mirroring the backend pair:

### `hexagonal-frontend.md` (core)

Primary skill. Contains layer rules, naming rules, React-specific style constraints, and the auto-invocation trigger. Auto-invoked when an agent writes or modifies files inside `use-cases/` or `shared-repositories/` within a frontend module.

**Trigger description (frontmatter):**
> Use when implementing any feature that involves frontend/React code — use case components, hooks, or repositories inside a client-side module. Also use when the user runs /hexagonal-frontend to scaffold a new frontend module.

### `hexagonal-frontend-scaffold.md` (operation)

Invoked by the core skill during greenfield scaffolding. Produces the folder layout and a master README with React pseudocode. Not user-invoked directly — mirrors how `hexagonal-scaffold.md` works for the backend.

---

## <span style="color:#76a039">Invocation Forms</span>

```
/hexagonal-frontend checkout              # greenfield scaffold, base rules only
/hexagonal-frontend checkout @src/orders  # greenfield + style from reference codebase
/hexagonal-frontend                       # skill asks for the module name
(agent auto-invokes)                      # when writing/modifying frontend service-layer code
```

---

## <span style="color:#76a039">Folder Structure</span>

There is no top-level `repositories/` folder. Repositories live co-located with their use case domain folder. They are only promoted to `shared-repositories/` once they are needed by more than one domain.

```
use-cases/
  Company/                        ← Business Domain named folder
    ViewCompany.tsx               ← use case component (action + domain: View + Company)
    useViewCompany.ts             ← extracted hook behavior; implementation detail of the use case
    companyRepository.ts          ← repository; co-located with its domain

  Customer/                       ← Business Domain named folder
    Address/                      ← Sub-domain folder
      EditAddress.tsx             ← use case component
      useEditAddress.ts           ← extracted hook behavior
      addressRepository.ts        ← repository; co-located

shared-repositories/              ← promoted here only once a repository is needed by 2+ domains
```

No `controllers/` folder. No `data/` folder. No `components/` root folder.

---

## <span style="color:#76a039">The Three Organizing Concepts</span>

### <span style="color:#76a039">1. Domain folders</span>

Folders are named after **Business Domain concepts** — the nouns of the business: `Company`, `Customer`, `Address`, `Profile`, `Product`. These are not technical terms. `Card` is not a domain name; it is a UI pattern term. Domain names are business vocabulary.

Sub-domains nest inside their parent: `Customer/Address/`, `Company/Billing/`.

### <span style="color:#76a039">2. Use case components</span>

A use case component is a React component named as **Action verb + Business Domain noun**. The action describes what the user is doing; the domain noun identifies the business concept being acted on.

| Action | Domain | Component name |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| View | Company | `ViewCompany.tsx` |
| Edit | Address | `EditAddress.tsx` |
| Find | Crafters | `FindCrafters.tsx` |
| Add | Profile | `AddProfile.tsx` |
| View | Account | `ViewAccount.tsx` |

Use case components are the entry point for a user action. They are **humble** — they render UI and delegate all behavior to their companion hook. No business logic lives inside the component JSX.

### <span style="color:#76a039">3. Hooks (extracted behavior)</span>

A hook is the logic extracted from its use case component to keep the component humble. It is an **implementation detail of the use case**, not a separate architectural layer. It lives co-located in the same domain folder as its component.

Named as `use` + the use case component name: `useViewCompany`, `useEditAddress`, `useFindCrafters`.

The hook orchestrates the repository. It handles loading state, error state, and any business decisions (branching on response, validation). It knows nothing about rendering.

**Humble views.** By pushing all behavior into the hook, the use case component becomes a humble view — it knows only how to render what it is given and which user events to report. It holds no logic of its own. This separation is what makes the view testable in isolation and the behavior testable without a rendering environment.

---

## <span style="color:#76a039">Atoms and Domain Compositions</span>

### <span style="color:#76a039">Atoms</span>

Atoms are **generic, domain-ignorant UI primitives** — the smallest composable units: `Header`, `Badge`, `Card`, `Arrow`, `Button`, `Spinner`. Their names are technical/UI terms only. They have zero knowledge of the business or domain. `Badge` does not know what a `Company` is.

Atoms live in `components/` at the module root. They are **never** placed inside a domain folder.

### <span style="color:#76a039">Domain compositions</span>

A domain composition is a React component that **wraps one or more atoms and adds domain context**. It is larger than an atom and more specific, but it is not a use case — it carries no action verb and represents no user action. It is a presentation building block for a specific domain concept.

`CompanyHeader` wraps `Header` (the atom) and renders it with Company-specific data. `CompanyBadge` wraps `Badge` and renders it with Company status. These live **co-located inside their domain folder**.

```
components/
  Header.tsx               ← atom: generic, no domain knowledge
  Badge.tsx                ← atom: generic, no domain knowledge
  Card.tsx
  Arrow.tsx

use-cases/
  Company/
    ViewCompany.tsx        ← use case: Action + Domain; composes domain compositions
    useViewCompany.ts      ← hook
    companyRepository.ts
    CompanyHeader.tsx      ← domain composition: wraps Header atom, adds Company context
    CompanyBadge.tsx       ← domain composition: wraps Badge atom, adds Company status
```

Domain compositions must not call hooks or repositories. They receive all data via props from the use case component that owns them.

---

## <span style="color:#76a039">Layer Rules</span>

### <span style="color:#76a039">Use case components</span>

- Named `[Action][Domain].tsx`. PascalCase. One component per file.
- **Humble view** — delegates all behavior to its companion hook (`use[Action][Domain].ts`). The component renders what it is given and reports user events. Nothing more.
- Must not call a repository directly.
- Props are plain domain objects — not raw API response shapes.
- No business logic in JSX.

### <span style="color:#76a039">Hooks</span>

- Named `use[Action][Domain].ts`. camelCase file name.
- The single place where loading state, error state, and business decisions for a use case live.
- Calls the repository for data access.
- No rendering logic. Returns plain data and handler functions to the component.
- Must not import global HTTP clients — receives them (or the repository) as a dependency.

### <span style="color:#76a039">Repositories</span>

- Named `[domain]Repository.ts`. camelCase file name (e.g. `companyRepository.ts`).
- The single place where fetch/axios and API endpoint URLs live.
- Translates between domain objects and API request/response shapes.
- Returns plain domain objects, not raw API response shapes.
- **No retry logic, no fallback strategy, no orchestration across multiple API calls** — those belong in the hook/use case.
- Co-located in the domain folder. Promoted to `shared-repositories/` only when needed by 2+ domains.

### <span style="color:#76a039">Shared repositories</span>

- Live in `shared-repositories/` at the module root.
- Same rules as co-located repositories — promotion changes location, not behavior.
- Only promoted when genuinely shared. Do not pre-emptively move a repository here.

---

## <span style="color:#76a039">Naming Rules (enforced everywhere)</span>

- **Domain folders: business nouns only.** `Company`, `Customer`, `Address`. Not `Card`, `List`, `Container`, `Widget`.
- **Use case components: Action + Domain.** The action is a verb from the user's perspective (`View`, `Edit`, `Find`, `Add`, `Remove`, `Manage`). The domain is the business noun.
- **Hooks: `use` + use case name.** `useViewCompany`, `useEditAddress`.
- **Repositories: domain noun + `Repository`.** `companyRepository`, `addressRepository`.
- **Atoms: generic UI terms only.** `Header`, `Badge`, `Card`, `Arrow`, `Button`. Never domain-named. Never placed inside a domain folder.
- **Domain compositions: Domain noun only, no action verb.** `CompanyHeader`, `CompanyBadge`. Wraps atoms, adds domain context. Lives in the domain folder. Receives all data via props — no hooks, no repositories.
- **Test names in prose, domain language.** Never function names or implementation references. *"shows the company name and badge when the company is active"*, not *"calls useViewCompany with the company id"*.
- **TypeScript types on all public-facing function signatures.**

## <span style="color:#76a039">How Repositories Differ from Backend Repositories</span>

On the backend, repositories are ports backed by a separate `data/` adapter. On the frontend, there is no separate data adapter — the repository is both port and adapter in one file. This is intentional: the abstraction cost of a data adapter layer on the client side is not worth the benefit. The repository directly wraps the HTTP call. If that HTTP client ever changes, only the repository changes.

---

## <span style="color:#76a039">Composition with `/hexagonal` (E2E Features)</span>

When building an end-to-end feature:

- The backend module is governed by `hexagonal.md`: controllers → use-cases → repositories → data.
- The frontend module is governed by `hexagonal-frontend.md`: use case components → hooks → repositories.
- The frontend repositories call the backend controllers (the API endpoints).
- The same domain language flows through both sides. A `Company` on the backend is a `Company` on the frontend.

Neither skill invokes the other. When a `/feature` slice is built end-to-end, both skills auto-invoke in their respective areas based on which files are being touched.

---

## <span style="color:#76a039">Greenfield Scaffold</span>

Invoked by `/hexagonal-frontend <module-name>`. Produces:

```
<module-name>/
  components/            ← generic, domain-ignorant UI atoms (Header, Badge, Card)
  use-cases/             ← domain-named subfolders; use case components, hooks, repositories
  shared-repositories/   ← empty; promoted from domain folders when shared by 2+ domains
  shared-state/          ← empty; promoted from domain folders when shared by 2+ domains
  shared-validation/     ← empty; promoted from domain folders when shared by 2+ domains
  README.md              ← layer rules and React pseudocode
```

No `data/` folder. No `controllers/` folder. No `domain/` folder. Tech stack: React + Vite (no framework).

The README includes React pseudocode showing the full dependency flow: use case component → hook → repository → API call.

## <span style="color:#76a039">Summary: The Composition Chain</span>

**Atoms** are the raw material — generic, domain-ignorant UI primitives (`Header`, `Badge`, `Card`). They know nothing about the business.

**Domain Compositions** give atoms domain context. `CompanyHeader` wraps `Header` and makes it about `Company`. They are named after the domain concept they present, carry no action verb, and hold no behavior. They are pure presentation.

**Use Cases hold the Action against the Domain Composition.** `ViewCompany` is the action (`View`) applied to the domain (`Company`). It is the entry point for a user's intent. It composes domain compositions, delegates behavior to its hook, and connects to the repository through that hook. The action only exists at the use case level — atoms and domain compositions never carry it.

```
atoms/          Header, Badge, Card          ← generic; no domain, no action
                       ↓ composed into
domain folder/  CompanyHeader, CompanyBadge  ← domain context; no action
                       ↓ composed into
use-cases/      ViewCompany                  ← action + domain; behavior via hook → repository
```

---

## <span style="color:#76a039">Decisions</span>

All open questions resolved:

1. **Atoms folder name** → `components/`. Generic, domain-ignorant UI primitives live in `components/` at the module root.

2. **Auto-invocation detection** → `.tsx` file extension. If the file being written or modified is `.tsx`, the frontend skill fires. Backend files are `.ts` or `.py` — never `.tsx`. Simple and unambiguous.

3. **State management** → Same co-location pattern as repositories. A store lives in the domain folder alongside its use case. Promoted to `shared-state/` at the module root only when genuinely needed by 2+ domains.

4. **Form validation** → Same co-location pattern. Validation lives next to the use case in the domain folder. Promoted to `shared-validation/` at the module root only when genuinely shared by 2+ use cases.

5. **Next.js / RSC** → Not applicable. The stack is plain React + Vite, no framework.
